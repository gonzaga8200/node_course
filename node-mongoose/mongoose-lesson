- It's not imposed any structure.
- However if you want to add a strucuture -> Mongoose
- Mongoose it's a node module -> Object Data Model;
- Ass strcuture to Mongodb documents though schema
- Mongoose has the same feature mongodb
- db.on and db.once
- Shema: strucuture of the data to be stored
- Defines all the fileds and types.
- Example var dishSchema = new Schema({
    name: {type: String, required:true, unique: true},
    description:{type:String, required: true}},
    {timestamps:true})
})

var Dishes = mongoose.model('Dishes',dishSchema);
- Collection name is in Plural
- Mongoose allows embeded document schema ( nest shema , let's say )
